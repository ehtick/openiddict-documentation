# Migrate to OpenIddict 6.0

## What's new?

> [!NOTE]
> **Migrating to OpenIddict 6.0 doesn't require making changes to your database** but new APIs have been added to the stores and
existing APIs have been reworked: if you're using custom stores, you'll need to tweak them when upgrading to OpenIddict 6.0.

## Update your packages references

For that, update your `.csproj` file to reference the `OpenIddict` 6.x packages. For instance:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <!-- OpenIddict 4.x: -->
  <PackageReference Include="OpenIddict.AspNetCore" Version="5.8.0" />
  <PackageReference Include="OpenIddict.EntityFrameworkCore" Version="5.8.0" />

  <!-- OpenIddict 5.x: -->
  <PackageReference Include="OpenIddict.AspNetCore" Version="6.0.0-rc1.24608.69" />
  <PackageReference Include="OpenIddict.EntityFrameworkCore" Version="6.0.0-rc1.24608.69" />
</ItemGroup>
```

> [!NOTE]
> Migrating to ASP.NET Core 9.0 is not required, as OpenIddict 6.0 is still natively compatible with ASP.NET Core 2.1
> (.NET Framework-only), ASP.NET Core 6.0 and ASP.NET Core 8.0. Moving to a newer .NET runtime or ASP.NET Core can
> (and even should!) be done separately for a simpler/decoupled upgrade:
>
> | Web framework version | .NET runtime version |
> |-----------------------|----------------------|
> | ASP.NET Core 2.1      | .NET Framework 4.6.2 |
> | ASP.NET Core 2.1      | .NET Framework 4.7.2 |
> | ASP.NET Core 2.1      | .NET Framework 4.8   |
> |                       |                      |
> | ASP.NET Core 6.0      | .NET 6.0             |
> | ASP.NET Core 8.0      | .NET 8.0             |
> | ASP.NET Core 9.0      | .NET 9.0             |
> |                       |                      |
> | Microsoft.Owin 4.2    | .NET Framework 4.6.2 |
> | Microsoft.Owin 4.2    | .NET Framework 4.7.2 |
> | Microsoft.Owin 4.2    | .NET Framework 4.8   |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The .NET 7.0 and .NET Framework 4.6.1 TFMs have been removed as these versions are no longer supported by Microsoft.
>
> While most OpenIddict 6.0 packages can still be used on these versions thanks to their .NET Standard 2.0 or 2.1 TFMs, doing
> that is strongly discouraged and users are instead encouraged to migrate to .NET 8.0 and .NET Framework 4.6.2 (or higher).

## React to the naming changes impacting some of the server endpoints

Some of the server endpoints have been renamed in OpenIddict 6.0 to be more specific or more closely match the official names,
which should reduce ambiguities and make migrating from other OAuth 2.0/OIDC stacks to OpenIddict easier:

| OpenIddict 5.x        | OpenIddict 6.x                 |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------|
| Cryptography endpoint | JSON Web Key Set endpoint      |
| Device endpoint       | Device authorization endpoint  |
| Logout endpoint       | End-session endpoint           |
| Userinfo endpoint     | UserInfo endpoint              |
| Verification endpoint | End-user verification endpoint |

As such, all the constants, builder methods, events and event handlers used by the OpenIddict client, core, server and validation
stacks have been updated to use the new names. In most cases, reacting to this breaking change should be limited to just changing
a few lines in your `Startup` file:

| OpenIddict 5.x                          | OpenIddict 6.x                                 |
|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `options.SetCryptographyEndpointUris()` | `options.SetJsonWebKeySetEndpointUris()`       |
| `options.SetDeviceEndpointUris()`       | `options.SetDeviceAuthorizationEndpointUris()` |
| `options.SetLogoutEndpointUris()`       | `options.SetEndSessionEndpointUris()`          |
| `options.SetUserinfoEndpointUris()`     | `options.SetUserInfoEndpointUris()`            |
| `options.SetVerificationEndpointUris()` | `options.SetEndUserVerificationEndpointUris()` |

| OpenIddict 5.x                  | OpenIddict 6.x                           |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `options.AllowDeviceCodeFlow()` | `options.AllowDeviceAuthorizationFlow()` |

| OpenIddict 5.x                                    | OpenIddict 6.x                                           |
|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `options.EnableLogoutEndpointPassthrough()`       | `options.EnableEndSessionEndpointPassthrough()`          |
| `options.EnableUserinfoEndpointPassthrough()`     | `options.EnableUserInfoEndpointPassthrough()`            |
| `options.EnableVerificationEndpointPassthrough()` | `options.EnableEndUserVerificationEndpointPassthrough()` |


| OpenIddict 5.x                                     | OpenIddict 6.x                                                  |
|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `OpenIddictConstants.Permissions.Endpoints.Device` | `OpenIddictConstants.Permissions.Endpoints.DeviceAuthorization` |
| `OpenIddictConstants.Permissions.Endpoints.Logout` | `OpenIddictConstants.Permissions.Endpoints.EndSession`          |

> [!TIP]
> While not mandatory (as the permissions containing the old endpoint names are still fully functional in 6.x for backward compatibility),
> you can also update your applications table/database to use the new constant values (i.e `ept:device_authorization` and `ept:end_session`
> instead of `ept:device` and `ept:logout`).

## React to the changes affecting prompt values in authorization requests

Complete support for the the [*Initiating User Registration via OpenID Connect*](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-prompt-create-1_0.html)
specification has been introduced in OpenIddict 6.0, that will now automatically validate the `prompt` parameter to ensure the value
is supported and return the supported values in the server configuration document using the new standard `prompt_values_supported` node
(see https://github.com/openiddict/openiddict-core/pull/2197 for more information).

If you're using custom prompt values (i.e values different from `consent`, `login`, `select_account` and `none`), you'll need to
update your server configuration to ensure these custom values are not rejected by OpenIddict when validating authorization requests:

```csharp
services.AddOpenIddict()
    .AddServer(options =>
    {
        // ...

        options.RegisterPromptValues("custom_value_1", "custom_value_2");
    });
```

As part of this change, the `OpenIddictConstants.Prompts` class have been renamed to `OpenIddictConstants.PromptValues` and the
`OpenIddictRequest.GetPrompts()`/`OpenIddictRequest.HasPrompt()` extensions have been renamed to `OpenIddictRequest.GetPromptValues()`
and `OpenIddictRequest.HasPromptValue()` to match the names used in this specification. If you're using these APIs, make sure you're
updating the corresponding calls when migrating to OpenIddict 6.0.

## If applicable, migrate to `MongoDB.Driver` version 3.0

To fix a breaking change introduced by the MongoDB in their 2.x branch, the `OpenIddict.MongoDb` and `OpenIddict.MongoDb.Models`
packages now reference `MongoDB.Driver` and `MongoDB.Bson` version 3.0.0 and are now strong-named starting with OpenIddict 6.0:
OpenIddict users relying on the MongoDB integration will also need to update their MongoDB driver dependencies when upgrading OpenIddict.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The third iteration of the C# MongoDB driver no longer supports .NET Standard 2.0 and requires .NET Framework 4.7.2 as
> the minimum version: projects referencing the `OpenIddict.MongoDb` or `OpenIddict.MongoDb.Models` packages and targeting
> .NET Standard 2.0 or .NET Framework < 4.7.2 will have to be updated when migrating to OpenIddict 6.0.

## If applicable, updated your checks to ensure authenticated identities are correctly identified (OWIN only)

In OpenIddict 6.0, the ASP.NET Core and OWIN integrations now include the authentication properties attached to
`ProcessAuthenticationContext.Properties` in errored authentication results, which is useful when used with the client stack
as it allows retrieving custom and non-custom properties attached to the `state` token when using the "error pass-through mode".

As part of this change, the OWIN hosts now return an `AuthenticateResult` instance containing an empty `ClaimsIdentity`
with its `IsAuthenticated` property set to `false` (instead of a `null` identity) to represent errored authentication demands.

If you're using the error pass-through mode **and** are calling `await AuthenticateAsync(OpenIddict*OwinDefaults.AuthenticationType)`,
make sure you're updating your `if` checks to ensure authenticated identities are correctly identified:

```csharp
var result = await context.Authentication.AuthenticateAsync(OpenIddictClientOwinDefaults.AuthenticationType);
if (result is { Identity.IsAuthenticated: true })
{
    // The authentication result represents an authenticated user.
}
```

## If applicable, update your custom stores

### New APIs

New authorization and token stores APIs have been introduced in OpenIddict 6.0 to make revocation faster:

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Revokes all the authorizations matching the specified parameters.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="subject">The subject associated with the authorization, or <see langword="null"/> not to filter out specific subjects.</param>
/// <param name="client">The client associated with the authorization, or <see langword="null"/> not to filter out specific clients.</param>
/// <param name="status">The authorization status, or <see langword="null"/> not to filter out specific authorization statuses.</param>
/// <param name="type">The authorization type, or <see langword="null"/> not to filter out specific authorization types.</param>
/// <param name="cancellationToken">The <see cref="CancellationToken"/> that can be used to abort the operation.</param>
/// <returns>The number of authorizations corresponding to the criteria that were marked as revoked.</returns>
ValueTask<long> RevokeAsync(string? subject, string? client, string? status, string? type, CancellationToken cancellationToken);

/// <summary>
/// Revokes all the authorizations associated with the specified application identifier.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="identifier">The application identifier associated with the authorizations.</param>
/// <param name="cancellationToken">The <see cref="CancellationToken"/> that can be used to abort the operation.</param>
/// <returns>The number of authorizations associated with the specified application that were marked as revoked.</returns>
ValueTask<long> RevokeByApplicationIdAsync(string identifier, CancellationToken cancellationToken);

/// <summary>
/// Revokes all the authorizations associated with the specified subject.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="subject">The subject associated with the authorizations.</param>
/// <param name="cancellationToken">The <see cref="CancellationToken"/> that can be used to abort the operation.</param>
/// <returns>The number of authorizations associated with the specified subject that were marked as revoked.</returns>
ValueTask<long> RevokeBySubjectAsync(string subject, CancellationToken cancellationToken);
```

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Revokes all the tokens matching the specified parameters.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="subject">The subject associated with the token, or <see langword="null"/> not to filter out specific subjects.</param>
/// <param name="client">The client associated with the token, or <see langword="null"/> not to filter out specific clients.</param>

/// <param name="type">The token type, or <see langword="null"/> not to filter out specific token types.</param>
/// <param name="cancellationToken">The <see cref="CancellationToken"/> that can be used to abort the operation.</param>
/// <returns>The number of tokens corresponding to the criteria that were marked as revoked.</returns>
ValueTask<long> RevokeAsync(string? subject, string? client, string? status, string? type, CancellationToken cancellationToken);

/// <summary>
/// Revokes all the tokens associated with the specified application identifier.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="identifier">The application identifier associated with the tokens.</param>
/// <param name="cancellationToken">The <see cref="CancellationToken"/> that can be used to abort the operation.</param>
/// <returns>The number of tokens associated with the specified application that were marked as revoked.</returns>
ValueTask<long> RevokeByApplicationIdAsync(string identifier, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);

/// <summary>
/// Revokes all the tokens associated with the specified authorization identifier.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="identifier">The authorization identifier associated with the tokens.</param>
/// <param name="cancellationToken">The <see cref="CancellationToken"/> that can be used to abort the operation.</param>
/// <returns>The number of tokens associated with the specified authorization that were marked as revoked.</returns>
ValueTask<long> RevokeByAuthorizationIdAsync(string identifier, CancellationToken cancellationToken);

/// <summary>
/// Revokes all the tokens associated with the specified subject.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="subject">The subject associated with the tokens.</param>
/// <param name="cancellationToken">The <see cref="CancellationToken"/> that can be used to abort the operation.</param>
/// <returns>The number of tokens associated with the specified subject that were marked as revoked.</returns>
ValueTask<long> RevokeBySubjectAsync(string subject, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
```

### Updated and removed APIs

All the existing `FindAsync()` overloads present in the authorization and token stores have been merged in
OpenIddict 6.0 into a single overload to make them more flexible. All the parameters are now optional:

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Retrieves the authorizations matching the specified parameters.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="subject">The subject associated with the authorization, or <see langword="null"/> not to filter out specific subjects.</param>
/// <param name="client">The client associated with the authorization, or <see langword="null"/> not to filter out specific clients.</param>
/// <param name="status">The authorization status, or <see langword="null"/> not to filter out specific authorization statuses.</param>
/// <param name="type">The authorization type, or <see langword="null"/> not to filter out specific authorization types.</param>
/// <param name="scopes">The minimal scopes associated with the authorization, or <see langword="null"/> not to filter out scopes.</param>
/// <param name="cancellationToken">The <see cref="CancellationToken"/> that can be used to abort the operation.</param>
/// <returns>The authorizations corresponding to the criteria.</returns>
IAsyncEnumerable<TAuthorization> FindAsync(
    string? subject, string? client,
    string? status, string? type,
    ImmutableArray<string>? scopes, CancellationToken cancellationToken);
```

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Retrieves the tokens matching the specified parameters.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="subject">The subject associated with the token, or <see langword="null"/> not to filter out specific subjects.</param>
/// <param name="client">The client associated with the token, or <see langword="null"/> not to filter out specific clients.</param>
/// <param name="status">The token status, or <see langword="null"/> not to filter out specific token statuses.</param>
/// <param name="type">The token type, or <see langword="null"/> not to filter out specific token types.</param>
/// <param name="cancellationToken">The <see cref="CancellationToken"/> that can be used to abort the operation.</param>
/// <returns>The tokens corresponding to the criteria.</returns>
IAsyncEnumerable<TToken> FindAsync(
    string? subject, string? client,
    string? status, string? type, CancellationToken cancellationToken);
```
