## Security policy

## Development

This repository uses [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/). For more information, read [Getting started](https://vitepress.dev/guide/getting-started).

## Support policy

If you need support, please first make sure you're [sponsoring the project](https://github.com/sponsors/kevinchalet).
Depending on the tier you selected, you can open a GitHub ticket or send an email to contact@openiddict.com for private support.
Alternatively, you can also post your question on [Gitter](https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#openiddict_openiddict-core:gitter.im).

**Support is only offered for the latest stable version of OpenIddict**. There are, however, two exceptions to this policy:
  - **ABP Framework users receive patches for OpenIddict for as long as ABP Framework itself is supported by Volosoft**
  (typically a year following the release of a major ABP version), whether they have a commercial ABP license or just use the free packages.

  | OpenIddict branch | ABP Framework branch | End of support date (estimated) |

  | 4.x               | 7.x                  | December 19, 2024               |

  | 6.x (current)     | 9.x                  | Currently supported             |
